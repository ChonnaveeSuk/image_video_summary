Lyrics:
We‚Äôre no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking of
You wouldn‚Äôt get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I‚Äôm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We‚Äôve known each other for so long
Your heart‚Äôs been aching but you‚Äôre too shy to say it
Inside we both know what‚Äôs been going on
We know the game and we‚Äôre gonna play it

And if you ask me how I‚Äôm feeling
Don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Muppets Characters
Gonzo is a multi-talented artist who performs outrageous daredevil stunts. Though an odd looking creature, Gonzo takes pride in his uniqueness and enjoys every adventure he goes on with the Muppets including the occasional space voyage. 

Rowlf the Dog is the Muppet‚Äôs resident piano player. One of the Muppets oldest characters, Rowlf rose to stardom by first plugging advertisements for his favorite dog-food brands on the original Muppets show. Rowlf the Dog is not the trusty Muppets sidekick  always ready to help Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, and the rest of the Muppets. 

Animal is the wild drummer for the almost-legendary band, Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem, who are the regular performers traveling with the Muppets. Animal is the official musical Muppet. Known for his outrageous style and unclear speaking voice, Animal is a crazed percussionist with three music style - loud, louder and loudest.

Pepe the King Prawn, lovingly known as Pepe, comes to the Muppets from Spain. Pepe moved to Hollywood to pursue his one true calling show business. Peep‚Äôs strong spanish accent makes it difficult for him to be understood.

Not one to leave the Muppet Lab too often, Beaker is the accident-prone assistant to Dr. Bunsen Honeydew. Though often difficult to understand, due to his ‚ÄúMeep‚Äù, Beaker is known among the Muppets as the one who always gets hurt. 

When the Muppets made it big, they needed to hire a fool-proof security guard. Thus, Bobo the Bear became head of Muppets security. 

Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant Beaker are the resident scientists of the Muppets experimenting away in the Muppets Lab. Bunsen is always eager to show off his latest scientific discoveries to the Muppets. 

Fozzie Bear is the world‚Äôs funniest‚Äîand only‚Äî stand-up comedy bear. From his beat-up hat to the ‚Äúwocka wocka‚Äù that punctuates his punchlines, Fozzie is an ‚Äúold school‚Äù comic. His jokes aren‚Äôt always great, but they are delivered with heart and Fozzie‚Äôs signature pazazz. 

Miss Piggy is the ultimate diva, leading lady, fashion icon, star of stage, screen, and all media known and unknown in perpetuity throughout the universe. Miss Piggy has an appetite for the good things in life, including chocolate, jewelry, awards, and above all, her one true love, Kermit the Frog.

Kermit is the world‚Äôs most famous frog, but he has never let  international success go to his head. Arguably one of Jim Henson‚Äôs most famous Muppet creations, Kermit the Frog has come a long way from his home, the swamp, to become one of TV‚Äôs most beloved characters.
